Code and data to train computer vision enriched discrete choice models in PyTorch

The file "data_CV_DCM.csv" contains data from a stated choice experiment. In the experiment, respondents were presented two residential location alternatives, and were asked to indicate which alternative they would choose. Both alternatives comprise travel time, monthly housing cost and an image showing the street-level conditions. Here you see a screenshot of a choice task from the stated choice experiment.
