# Computer-vision-enriched-DCMs
This repo contains code and data to train computer vision enriched discrete choice models in PyTorch.



The file "data_CV_DCM.csv" contains data from a stated choice experiment. In the experiment, respondents were presented two residential location alternatives, and were asked to indicate which alternative they would choose. Both alternatives comprise travel time, monthly housing cost and an image showing the street-level conditions. Here you see a screenshot of a choice task from the stated choice experiment.

More details about the data collection can be found in section 3 of the associated paper:
[Van Cranenburgh & Garrido-Valenzuela (2023)](VanCranenburgh2023.pdf)

Code to train CV-DCMs is coming soon.
